# telegram-mcqs-maker

Created in 30 minutes with chatgpt o1 :)

You need bun to run this project not nodejs :)

https://bun.sh/docs/installation

Make sure API keys are correct as mentioned in .env.example

Run `bun run dev` to start the server.

Use `/start` to start the bot, then `/make_mcqs <prompt>` to make mcqs.
